/*
- Give them base class conference role
- Loop thru the courses they ticked in the form and give them those roles, otherwise create new ones if they hadn't already existed
- Every role created from the form will have the following permissions stated in lines 110-111
- For each new channel, iterate thru all of them to create text channels with the specific course names
- Set text and voice to sync with the category permissions (so basically all students with base "class conference" role will only see the channels)
- send them confirmation -> the end lol
