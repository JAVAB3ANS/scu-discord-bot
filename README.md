# SCU DISCORD NETWORK

## Discord.JS BOT
- This is a 24/7 bot that I made for my [**SCU Discord Network**](https://invite.gg/gobroncos) to provide a comprehensive and effective social media platform for Santa Clara University students to utilize especially in the midst of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

  - Utilized the Node.js environment and Node module Discord.js to deploy a bot that greets/sends direct messages, interacts with over 500 students, and performs an assortment of automated tasks to better the server experience.

  - Programmed an Express.js server to link with a Google Form that automatically gives graduating year, college major, and verified roles to SCU students.

  - Utilized the Google Scripts API to log user suggestions/constructive feedback inside channels from an external form input.

  - Will be open to promote this server as a student-run online network if possible by institutional measures.
