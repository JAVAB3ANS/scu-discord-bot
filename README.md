# SCU DISCORD NETWORK

## Discord BOT
- This is a 24/7 bot that I made for my [SCU Discord Network](https://discord.gg/YusWdfu) to provide a comprehensive and effective social media platform for Santa Clara University students to utilize especially in the midst of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

  - Utilized the Node.js environment and Node module Discord.js to enable a bot to greet/send direct messages, interact with over 400 students, and perform an assortment of automated tasks.
  - Programmed an Express server to link with a Google Form that automatically gives (e.g. graduating year, major/program of study, and verified student) roles to undergraduates in the SCU organization.
  - Will be open to making this an official student-run online network if possible.
