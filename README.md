# Discord.JS BOT
- This is a 24/7 bot that I made for my [**SCU Discord Network**](https://invite.gg/gobroncos) to provide a comprehensive and effective social media platform for Santa Clara University students to utilize especially in the midst of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

  - Utilized the Node.js environment and Node module Discord.js to deploy a bot that greets/sends direct messages, interacts with over 500 students, and performs an assortment of automated tasks to better the server experience.

  - Programmed an Express.js server for a guild verification system which automatically gives graduating year, college major, and verified roles to SCU students on submitting their unique Google Form responses.

  - Crafted the ModMail ticket system which allows members to seek immediate support from admins/mods.

  - Very open to promoting this student-run online network and applying for [Discord's Partner Program](https://discord.com/partners) soon.
